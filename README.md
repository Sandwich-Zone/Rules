# Unassailable Sandwich Rights
We hold these sandwiches to be self evident in the eyes of the Earl of Sandwich. The bringing in of sandwich items to the sandwich zone guarantees the right to sandwiches. The **Sandwich Fixin' Exchange Rate** is established by fiat by the Earl of Sandwich, amendable to economic advisory from Sandwich Citizens.
